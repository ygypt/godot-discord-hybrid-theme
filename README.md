# Godot/Discord Hybrid Theme
The theme is pretty straight forward, it incorporates the vibrant yet soft syntax highlighting of Godot with the dark and smooth UI of Discord.

Until VSCode supports selecting seperate UI and syntax themes, this is the easiest way to mix the "GDScript" theme and the "Discord Tools" theme, which is where I got the hex values from. 

I changed the left panel notification colour to the old-school Discord blurple from a bright red because the red is rather distracting. If you would like to override it back to the "Discord Tools" setting of red, the hex value is `#F04747`.

If I make any additional deviations from the two themes listed above I'll make sure to jot them down here.

**Enjoy!**
